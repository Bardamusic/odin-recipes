  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
  Summer brings a breath of fresh air to our tables! It also inspires us to organize parties and drinks with our friends more often, perhaps on the balcony, by candlelight and with our favorite music playing in the background. You can prepare lots of delicious finger food on such pleasant occasions, along with desserts for a wonderful end to the evening, just like these <strong>coconut bites</strong>. These fresh and white balls are perfect for all occasions when there are lots of guests and you have little time on your hands! Preparing sumptuous and scenographic desserts is always hugely satisfying, but often you'll find it is handier to anticipate preparations, so that you have more time for your guests!<strong>Coconut bites</strong> are also perfect if you are alone and fancy a sweet break. Ricotta cheese, sugar and coconut: 3 ingredients that will turn into a perfect summer dessert in just 20 minutes. Soft, fresh and delicious! But be warned, because these coconut treats are irresistibly morish and will disappear fast!
