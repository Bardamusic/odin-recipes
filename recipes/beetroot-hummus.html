  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>If you love hummus, get ready for our even richer and more colorful version. Beetroot hummus is prepared in just a few minutes and will give your aperitifs a truly original touch! Within this variant there will be chickpeas and tahini, two of the fundamental ingredients of this Middle Eastern sauce. As many of you know, tahini is a paste made with sesame seeds that gives a truly distinctive taste. Having added the beetroot to contrast its sweetness and balance this cream, we indulged ourselves with spices, which you can customize according to your taste.

  Beetroot hummus is perfect to enrich your wraps, to be enjoyed with croutons or together with raw vegetables. An appetizer you won't want to give up anymore, especially during the summer!
